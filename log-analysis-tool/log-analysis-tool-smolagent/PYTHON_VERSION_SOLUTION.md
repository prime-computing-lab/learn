# Python Version Issue Solution

## Error Details

When setting up the Log Analysis Tool, you encountered the following error:

```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement smolagents>=1.14.0
ERROR: No matching distribution found for smolagents>=1.14.0
```

## Root Cause

The issue is that your system is using Python 3.9, but the `smolagents` library requires Python 3.10 or higher. This is clear from the error message:

```
ERROR: Ignored the following versions that require a different python version: 
0.1.0 Requires-Python >=3.10; 0.1.2 Requires-Python >=3.10; 
...
```

## Solutions

You have two options to resolve this issue:

### Option 1: Upgrade Python (Recommended)

1. Install Python 3.10 or higher using your preferred method:

   **Using Homebrew (recommended for macOS):**
   ```bash
   brew update
   brew install python@3.10
   ```

   **Or download from Python.org:**
   - Visit [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download Python 3.10+

2. After installation, run the setup script again:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

### Option 2: Use a Compatible Version of the Project

If you prefer to keep using Python 3.9, you can modify the project to not use SmoLAgent:

1. Remove SmoLAgent dependency from requirements.txt:
   ```bash
   sed -i '' '/smolagents/d' requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the setup script again:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. Note that this will disable the AI enhancement features described in the plan.

## How to Check Your Python Version

```bash
python3 --version
```

## Additional Notes

- The setup script has been updated to check for Python version compatibility before proceeding.
- If you're using Homebrew, ensure your Python installation is properly linked.
- If you have multiple Python installations, you may need to specify the correct Python binary explicitly.
